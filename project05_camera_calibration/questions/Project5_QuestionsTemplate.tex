% This is a LaTeX document. LaTeX is a markup language for producing documents.
% Your task is to answer the questions by filling out this document, then to
% compile this into a PDF document.
%
% TO COMPILE:
% > pdflatex thisfile.tex
%
% If you do not have LaTeX and need a LaTeX distribution:
% - Departmental machines have one installed.
% - Personal laptops (all common OS): http://www.latex-project.org/get/

\section*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 4 questions.
  \item Write code where appropriate.
  \item Feel free to include images or equations.
  \item Please make this document anonymous.
  \item On upload, \textbf{Gradescope will ask you to assign question numbers to your pages}. Making each question end with a page break after your answer is a good way to ease this process. \textbf{Failing to assign page numbers will result in a deduction.}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Q1:} Briefly describe triangulation (using images if you like). Why can't we find an absolute depth for each point when we don't have calibration information for our cameras?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A1:} Your answer here.

\paragraph{Q2:} Why does rectification simplify matching features across our stereo image pair? What information do we need to know to rectify our image pair?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A2:} Your answer here.

% Please leave the pagebreak

\paragraph{Q3:} What does it mean when the epipolar lines: a) radiate out of a point on the image plane, b) converge to a point outside of the image plane, or a) intersect at more than one point?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{A3:} Your answer here.

\paragraph{Q4:}
Suppose that we have the following three datasets of an object of unknown geometry:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A video circling the object;
\item An stereo pair of calibrated cameras capturing two images of the object; and
\item Two images we take of the object at two different camera poses (position and orientation) using the same camera but with different lens zoom settings.
\end{enumerate}
For each scenario:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain if we can calculate the essential matrix, fundamental matrix, or both;
\item State an advantage and disadvantage of using each setup for depth reconstruction; and
\item Name an application scenario for each of the different setups.
\end{enumerate}
